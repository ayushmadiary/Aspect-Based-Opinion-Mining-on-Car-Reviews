Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip.

Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean).

I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car.</td>\n",

As a former Prius owner, I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura, although I do miss the 50+ mpg of the Prius.  It's fun to drive, handles well, stops on a dime, and has all of the modern features you'd expect from an Acura.  I primarily drive around town (about 90% of the time) with lots of stopping and am averaging about 37-38 mpg.  I love the simplicity of the interior, which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at.  I hope this awesome car continues to fly under the radar so I'll continue to be one of the only ones on the road driving it!</td>\n",

However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car.\\n</td>\n",

Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "3  We bought our ILX used and have been incredibly pleased with it thus far.  As a former Prius owner, I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura, although I do miss the 50+ mpg of the Prius.  It's fun to drive, handles well, stops on a dime, and has all of the modern features you'd expect from an Acura.  I primarily drive around town (about 90% of the time) with lots of stopping and am averaging about 37-38 mpg.  I love the simplicity of the interior, which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at.  I hope this awesome car continues to fly under the radar so I'll continue to be one of the only ones on the road driving it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "4  In April of 2015 we were in need of another car. Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car.\\n  "

Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip.

Suspension and noise cancellation work amazingly well.\\nAlthough it looks small, it has plenty of room and has always been big enough. \\nGas mileage has been from 42 to 45 without really trying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1  I purchased my 2013 ILX from the dealer used with 30k miles in 2016. So far so good. I had a Honda before and loved it so figured my next step would be an Acura. First the positives: Car rides well, love the GPS, blue tooth connectivity, and voice control. For a 4 cylinder vehicle it accelerates quite quickly and is very good on gas. Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "2  I recently purchased a 2013 ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "3  We bought our ILX used and have been incredibly pleased with it thus far.  As a former Prius owner, I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura, although I do miss the 50+ mpg of the Prius.  It's fun to drive, handles well, stops on a dime, and has all of the modern features you'd expect from an Acura.  I primarily drive around town (about 90% of the time) with lots of stopping and am averaging about 37-38 mpg.  I love the simplicity of the interior, which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at.  I hope this awesome car continues to fly under the radar so I'll continue to be one of the only ones on the road driving it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4  In April of 2015 we were in need of another car. Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car.\\n   \n",

       "4  In April of 2015 we were in need of another car Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe both of which I loved being a man However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation a CD player heated seats etc I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time was fully loaded and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area On average with city and highway driving we average 393 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode We have kept up with oil changes etc and I dont know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20 of a new oil change The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic The only flaws I see are limited storage and no leg room for an adult in the back seats However the interior dash layout is great the hands free is one of the best I have used and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than 2400 to fill it and my wife can drive 46 weeks before filling It also looks like a higher dollar car We will always be an Acura fan due to this car\\n  "

       "      <td>In April of 2015 we were in need of another car. Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling.

       "1  I purchased my 2013 ILX from the dealer used with 30k miles in 2016. So far so good. I had a Honda before and loved it so figured my next step would be an Acura. First the positives: Car rides well, love the GPS, blue tooth connectivity, and voice control. For a 4 cylinder vehicle it accelerates quite quickly and is very good on gas. Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "2  I recently purchased a 2013 ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "3  We bought our ILX used and have been incredibly pleased with it thus far.  As a former Prius owner, I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura, although I do miss the 50+ mpg of the Prius.  It's fun to drive, handles well, stops on a dime, and has all of the modern features you'd expect from an Acura.  I primarily drive around town (about 90% of the time) with lots of stopping and am averaging about 37-38 mpg.  I love the simplicity of the interior, which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at.

       "2  I recently purchased a 2013 ILX with the Tech pkg and I am very pleased with it I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration but I honestly dont A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered but I find the car to be adequate In fact it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I dont have trouble passing cars The interior is nice well built and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car As stated above this is an excellent commuter car                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "3  We bought our ILX used and have been incredibly pleased with it thus far  As a former Prius owner I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura although I do miss the 50 mpg of the Prius  Its fun to drive handles well stops on a dime and has all of the modern features youd expect from an Acura  I primarily drive around town about 90 of the time with lots of stopping and am averaging about 3738 mpg  I love the simplicity of the interior which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at  I hope this awesome car continues to fly under the radar so Ill continue to be one of the only ones on the road driving it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "4  In April of 2015 we were in need of another car Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe both of which I loved being a man However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation a CD player heated seats etc I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time was fully loaded and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area On average with city and highway driving we average 393 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode We have kept up with oil changes etc and I dont know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20 of a new oil change The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic The only flaws I see are limited storage and no leg room for an adult in the back seats However the interior dash layout is great the hands free is one of the best I have used and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than 2400 to fill it and my wife can drive 46 weeks before filling It also looks like a higher dollar car We will always be an Acura fan due to this car\\n   \n",

First the positives: Car rides well, love the GPS, blue tooth connectivity, and voice control. For a 4 cylinder vehicle it accelerates quite quickly and is very good on gas. Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats.\\n</td>\n",

As a former Prius owner, I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura, although I do miss the 50+ mpg of the Prius.  It's fun to drive, handles well, stops on a dime, and has all of the modern features you'd expect from an Acura.  I primarily drive around town (about 90% of the time) with lots of stopping and am averaging about 37-38 mpg.

       "      <td>In April of 2015 we were in need of another car. Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car.\\n</td>\n",

Suspension and noise cancellation work amazingly well.\\nAlthough it looks small, it has plenty of room and has always been big enough. \\nGas mileage has been from 42 to 45 without really trying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1  I purchased my 2013 ILX from the dealer used with 30k miles in 2016. So far so good. I had a Honda before and loved it so figured my next step would be an Acura. First the positives: Car rides well, love the GPS, blue tooth connectivity, and voice control. For a 4 cylinder vehicle it accelerates quite quickly and is very good on gas. Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "2  I recently purchased a 2013 ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "3  We bought our ILX used and have been incredibly pleased with it thus far.  As a former Prius owner, I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura, although I do miss the 50+ mpg of the Prius.  It's fun to drive, handles well, stops on a dime, and has all of the modern features you'd expect from an Acura.  I primarily drive around town (about 90% of the time) with lots of stopping and am averaging about 37-38 mpg.  I love the simplicity of the interior, which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at.  I hope this awesome car continues to fly under the radar so I'll continue to be one of the only ones on the road driving it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4  In April of 2015 we were in need of another car. Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car.\\n   \n",

       "4  In April of 2015 we were in need of another car Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe both of which I loved being a man However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation a CD player heated seats etc I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time was fully loaded and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area On average with city and highway driving we average 393 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode We have kept up with oil changes etc and I dont know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20 of a new oil change The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic The only flaws I see are limited storage and no leg room for an adult in the back seats However the interior dash layout is great the hands free is one of the best I have used and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than 2400 to fill it and my wife can drive 46 weeks before filling It also looks like a higher dollar car We will always be an Acura fan due to this car\\n   \n",

       "4  in april of 2015 we were in need of another car initially i looked at a bmw 335 and a infintity g37 coupe both of which i loved being a man however i knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation a cd player heated seats etc i ended up choosing the ilx as it was below the book value at the time was fully loaded and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market i also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the dfw area on average with city and highway driving we average 393 mpg with the car not in hybrid mode we have kept up with oil changes etc and i dont know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20 of a new oil change the front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the honda civic the only flaws i see are limited storage and no leg room for an adult in the back seats however the interior dash layout is great the hands free is one of the best i have used and though it takes premium gas i have never paid more than 2400 to fill it and my wife can drive 46 weeks before filling it also looks like a higher dollar car we will always be an acura fan due to this car\\n   \n",

Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean).

I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car.\\n</td>\n",

       "0  I love this car.\\nGas mileage, suspension, and stereo are great.\\nBluetooth integration and Pandora integration work perfectly. Suspension and noise cancellation work amazingly well.\\nAlthough it looks small, it has plenty of room and has always been big enough. \\nGas mileage has been from 42 to 45 without really trying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1  I purchased my 2013 ILX from the dealer used with 30k miles in 2016. So far so good. I had a Honda before and loved it so figured my next step would be an Acura. First the positives: Car rides well, love the GPS, blue tooth connectivity, and voice control. For a 4 cylinder vehicle it accelerates quite quickly and is very good on gas. Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "2  I recently purchased a 2013 ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "3  We bought our ILX used and have been incredibly pleased with it thus far.  As a former Prius owner, I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura, although I do miss the 50+ mpg of the Prius.  It's fun to drive, handles well, stops on a dime, and has all of the modern features you'd expect from an Acura.  I primarily drive around town (about 90% of the time) with lots of stopping and am averaging about 37-38 mpg.  I love the simplicity of the interior, which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at.  I hope this awesome car continues to fly under the radar so I'll continue to be one of the only ones on the road driving it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4  In April of 2015 we were in need of another car. Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling.

       "2  I recently purchased a 2013 ILX with the Tech pkg and I am very pleased with it I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration but I honestly dont A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered but I find the car to be adequate In fact it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I dont have trouble passing cars The interior is nice well built and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car As stated above this is an excellent commuter car                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "3  We bought our ILX used and have been incredibly pleased with it thus far  As a former Prius owner I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura although I do miss the 50 mpg of the Prius  Its fun to drive handles well stops on a dime and has all of the modern features youd expect from an Acura  I primarily drive around town about 90 of the time with lots of stopping and am averaging about 3738 mpg  I love the simplicity of the interior which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at  I hope this awesome car continues to fly under the radar so Ill continue to be one of the only ones on the road driving it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "4  In April of 2015 we were in need of another car Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe both of which I loved being a man However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation a CD player heated seats etc I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time was fully loaded and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area On average with city and highway driving we average 393 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode We have kept up with oil changes etc and I dont know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20 of a new oil change The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic The only flaws I see are limited storage and no leg room for an adult in the back seats However the interior dash layout is great the hands free is one of the best I have used and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than 2400 to fill it and my wife can drive 46 weeks before filling It also looks like a higher dollar car We will always be an Acura fan due to this car\\n   \n",

       "4  in april of 2015 we were in need of another car initially i looked at a bmw 335 and a infintity g37 coupe both of which i loved being a man however i knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation a cd player heated seats etc i ended up choosing the ilx as it was below the book value at the time was fully loaded and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market i also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the dfw area on average with city and highway driving we average 393 mpg with the car not in hybrid mode we have kept up with oil changes etc and i dont know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20 of a new oil change the front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the honda civic the only flaws i see are limited storage and no leg room for an adult in the back seats however the interior dash layout is great the hands free is one of the best i have used and though it takes premium gas i have never paid more than 2400 to fill it and my wife can drive 46 weeks before filling it also looks like a higher dollar car we will always be an acura fan due to this car\\n   \n",

Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats.\\n</td>\n",

However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car.\\n</td>\n",

I took a look at buying out my Civic, or purchasing another new Honda, but both of those options were thousands of $s more than a pre-owned ILX still under warranty. I am a car nut so I am quite familiar with the ILX and its relation to the Civic platform. The ILX fit my needs perfectly and solved most of the issues I had with my Civic (garbage infotainment system, NVH, pokey acceleration). The ILX is great for my longer highway commute, and the tech package is a must-have for the ELS audio. I don't really use the nav system but it works well the few times I played with it. Would like a bird's eye view option though. The only feature I miss from my Civic is the LaneWatch camera, but turning my head to check my blindspot is very easy and I feel the visibility is slightly better than on my Civic. Car is no rocket, but it is a willing partner when you punch it. No issues passing or getting up to speed at all. MPG is obviously less than my Civic, but I am still getting around 29-30 combined. Worth the MPG trade-off for the comfort level alone. Definitely could use a couple more storage cubbies and maybe another USB outlet, but I'll survive ha. Passengers report he backseat is roomy enough and comfy. I cant imagine why anyone would buy a new Kia Rio or a base Honda Fit when they can get a bulletproof-reliable, well-styled, feature-packed luxury-ish ILX for the same price.\\n</td>\n",

She wanted certain thing like a backup camera, leather, and navigation and the only car she could afford, that ticked those boxes was the Acura ILX.  I drive this car a fair amount, so I do have a good sense of the car.  First, this car DOES NOT feel like an Acura.  My dad has a 09 TSX and everything from the materials, comfort, suspension, and performance on the ILX does not feel like it is related to any Acura.  I have read from many forum discussions when the ILX first came out, that it is truly is a civic in disguise, that requires premium fuel and I can attest that it is.  Most built-in navigations are terrible, so I'm not surprised with the ILX's system, but how can a 2013 \"luxury\" sedan have such a cruddy back-up camera?  It does the job, but even the Toyota Corolla comes with a better camera.  The suspension feels like it was made out of very cheap components, as it feels like the right front wheel is already in need of a ball joint.  The exhaust shield fell off and the paint is prone to chipping.  My suggestion to anyone thinking about getting an ILX is to get an older TSX or just get a fully loaded Civic.\\n</td>\n",

The upgraded sound system is better than I would expect in this class of car.  There are a few minor drawbacks to the car, but based on the price point, you have to expect some trade offs.  First, the 150hp engine is sufficient for 80% of situations, but it’s definitely underpowered.  Get the optional 200hp engine if you can (I think in newer models they made it standard).  I have driven a 2018 with the 200hp, and it makes a huge difference.  Second, there are no memory seat buttons.  I didn’t think this would be a big deal when I was car shopping, but I realized quickly that I used memory seats way more often than I thought.  Then again, I’m someone who is overly sensitive to a seat position that’s slightly off from what I’m used to!

I have owned 3 other Hondas so I have seen, first hand, how their powertrains hold up as I maintain them myself. I was interested in either the '16 Civic LX 6MT or the '16 Accord Sport 6MT. I, personally, like the new civic but, at the time, only the LX had the 6MT available. I didn't want to spend ~$19 grand on the base model, base 4 speaker stereo and wheel covers.  I have been spoiled with the features I've come to enjoy in my 2007 Accord EX-L Sdn V6 6MT, I know I was being too harsh on the LX. I began to seriously consider the Accord Sport, it is a gorgeous car on the outside, but I found I would have to give up many features: quality stereo, sunroof and (at the time) leather on the inside. I have always loved the powertrain of the Civic Si, excellent engine and transmission but personally, I didn't want the Si and wasn't too fond of the interior. To every man his taste. I then noticed the ILX. I would never consider buying one brand new for $30k+, but a clean white one at ~$21k @ 10,000 miles and in immaculate shape it became an excellent choice! The new Accord Sport is pushing ~$27k but I got so many more features with the used ILX. I have throughly enjoyed this car and even with the 6MT coming available in the EX-T Civic I find I'm still enjoying my choice without regrets.  (I would really be sad if a Leather/Manual/Turbo civic option had popped up), even with the turbo manual option the Apple Car play is great but it still lacks a bit of a list of features ILX has. Some features I have really enjoyed are the sound system, there is a Sub in the back and the higher wattage is very noticable, much better sound and intensity than my fully loaded 2007 Accord EX-L. The HIDs are excellent, I purchased the car in OR and drove it to CA during a rain storm at night to outrun a snow storm. Those headlights were impressive for that drive, I could see both sides of the road (worried about deer) and much further I have ever been able to see with my other Hondas, the handling is also very light and precise through the mountains. What I wanted in a commuter was good powertrain, this car always puts a smile on my face driving home, this is the best manual transmission I have driven and that engine note never gets old. This thing is quick. Even on starting the engine it reminds you of its capabilities with that aggressive engine note. I've also been pleasantly surprised with the fuel economy. I commonly get ~40 mpg on my 40 mile commute one way, which includes hills and plenty of stop and go, I usually average 31MPG overall with lively city driving. On a longer drive to UT I saw an overall 34.5 MPG on the computer. I've only put premium in it and honestly don't mind the extra dollar or two at each fill up. Even with the newer choices of the Civic Turbo manual and even the excellent Mazda 3 I still went with and couldn't be happier with my choice in the ILX. My only gripe, echoing the many, was no Navigation. Fortunately I have it in my Accord. Honestly, It's a pleasant convenience in it but wasn't a deal breaker in the ILX for me. The screen in the ILX is honestly rather poor, but the sound system quality is what I was looking for. Another gripe is the fact that it revs a little too high for my taste on the freeway, but I like the shorter gear ratio than those longer gears found the Mazda 3 6MT.  The keyless entry and push button start has also an excellent feature I've come to truly enjoy. If you're looking for a good option, the ILX is a solid choice if you can find a good one off lease. This car is a tidy package for the long run. Also the fact that someone designed it so the oil filter is conveniently on the bottom of the engine directly behind the oil drain plug (rather than spilling all over the back of the engine like on the Honda\\n F series engine or spilling all over the subframe on the J series) is brilliant.\\nRead more\\n</td>\n",

It's no track monster, but for real road driving, I can't think of a car that was more fun (even more than my WRX) to drive around without doing illegal speeds.  Lastly, I find that the EPA gas mileage is easily exceeded without trying.  If I had to knock it on anything, it's the road noise.  For a 'premium' badge, I would have expected to be more quiet.

For just over $27,000 you get a lot of standard features including leather, 17\" wheels, back-up camera, luxury car dealership service treatment and Acura reliability.  The ILX handles great, for a small engine it is refined and smooth.  Acceleration is decent and the car feels more powerful than 150HP.

       "      <td>Before purchasing this car, I had a Mazda RX-8 which I had owned for 9 years.  I loved the car, I wasn't ready to give it up but the cost of repairs, the difficulty in repairing the car, the nickel and diming from Mazda because of the rotary engine was taking it's toll and it finally came time for me to consider trading the car in for something more reliable.  I had considered Audi and BMW, but the biggest \"want\" on my car wish list was that the vehicle had to be easy to repair and not cost an arm and a leg each time I took it in.  I just wanted something that had the sleekness and handling of my RX-8 but with the engine of a Honda.  So what better than an Acura?  Granted, when I test drove the ILX, I was rather bored, I thought the car was too sedate.  However, I had to remind myself that I was used to the squirreliness of the rear wheel drive on the RX-8 and that the sedateness of the ILX could be good for me.  While the ILX does not handle as well as the RX-8 (I am a rather aggressive driver and enjoyed the manual transmission on the Mazda), the ILX is pretty decent in acceleration, handles corners well (I don't have to worry about fish tailing), and has an overall feeling of \"gliding\" that I really enjoy.  I also love the interior.  Some of the reviews on the ILX will say the interior is not as nice as the Audi A3 or the BMW 3 series, but I beg to differ.  The interior is sleek and comfortable, the user interface on the touchscreen fairly easy to use.  The one complaint I do have is that the navigation app is only compatible with iPhone and as I am a Galaxy user, it is useless to me.  Also one thing to note with this car that salespeople at the dealership may argue with, is that this car performs WAY better on premium gasoline.  When I purchased the car, the sales person said the car takes regular gas.  I put regular in the car and experienced lagging at acceleration, rough idling, and I could feel the car stumbling when I would push down on the gas. When I brought it up to the guy who sold me the car, he said that was impossible, however, when I refueled with premium, the car was back to \"gliding\" and I have no trouble with acceleration.  Use your best judgement but don't always listen to the guy selling the car.  The guy who sold me my car knew nothing about the car and kept saying \"It is a beautiful car, it sells itself\".  Overall, I am very happy I did not go with Audi or BMW and know that when this car will need servicing, I will not walk out missing a huge piece of my paycheck.  It was a great transition from the RX-8.\\n</td>\n",

I previously owned a 2014 Civic EX 4dr, which I bought, at least partially, because Civics are traditionally modders, with a lot of potential for customization. Not so much the case (mechanically) anymore, unless you get the SI, but I work in the city and bumper to bumper commuting with a manual, forget it. At any rate, the ILX offered everything I wanted my Civic to become, sporty, both in appearance and performance (big emphasis on performance), as well as more luxury and Honda/Acura's legendary reliability. I did a LOT of research before pulling the trigger on the purchase and I just don't think that anything out there can touch the ILX if price is at all an issue for you. Go to Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Infiniti, Lexus websites and \"Build and Price\" their entry level offerings with same/similar features and you will see what I mean. In NONE of those cases are you getting anywhere near the ILX in features, performance, quality or reliability for under 40K (the model I bought, w/ premium package, stickers at $30,820 with destination charges). If you are looking to buy a status symbol, this isn't the car for you, but if you want luxury quality and performance combined with unmatched reliability, this is definitely worth a look and test drive, I consider it a class leading example of what I call \"practical luxury\". Also worth mention, I had a 2015 ILX base model (with the 2.0) loaner for a day and a half while the dealership installed a remote start and was NOT impressed, the 2015 would not have won me over, I would still be driving the Civic, so if you have an  earlier model and weren't pleased or it didn't meet your expectations, give the 2016 a test drive. \\n\\nThe only Cons I have to offer are getting into and out of the vehicle (at 5'11\" with short legs and a long torso) can be slightly awkward and low speed crawl can be chunky at times (for the first week till you get used to shift points) however from the reviews I have read on its competitors it still excels in this area (I haven't test driven any of them).\\n\\nUPDATE: After 8 months driving it every day, I still love this car. My only takeaway after 8 months is that without Navi the 2 screen layout can feel pretty redundant, but that's such a first world problem I don't even feel good complaining about it. Sport mode is awesome, whether or not you use the paddle shifters, which by the way can be used in normal drive mode as well.\\n</td>\n",

So far, not a single one.  The 8 speed DCT is very smooth and precise.  Driving in sport mode changes everything.  The shift points are at much higher revs and the engine responds much more quickly.

I can't attest to the reliability of the ILX, but I'm betting it will be similarly phenomenal.  The expert reviews are all over the map on this one.

Performance is up due to the new engine but the old one was efficient and peppy. Good ride quality and very good value in the entry level luxury class.

       "      <td>I really love this car.  It has everything I wanted for a great price!\\nPRO:\\n($30,000 out the door)\\nThis is the perfect car for me since I am not searching for people's envy.  This car has everything in my opinion. It has great gas mileage(I am averaging 32/gallon), galore of standard features like my favorites(resetting the gas odometer and mileage whenever I refuel, also 3 different backup camera viewing angle was very helpful when I need to back into my garage).  The leather are very comfortable.  Stereo with 7 speakers and sub-woofer, usb, bluetooth, HDMI, and sat radio keeps me going on my daily grind.  Great value for my hard earned cash.  I would recommend this car to anybody that appreciate great value and reliability.  \\nCON:\\nIf you are looking for true luxury entry-level luxury sedan, this is not it.  As per the review said, the interior are nice but not as luxuries as Mercedes or Audi.  It does not drive with peppiness that you get with Mercedes or Audi.  I find the acceleration weak but the thing is because this car is trying to save gas, so it keep shifting below 2000rpm....(you can do manual shifting if you are into burning up your gas and driving faster).  Your neighbor is not going to b like \"oh my! you got a new Mercedes or Audi!). But you know what? I got good price and great value for my car so F the neighbor...haha!\\n</td>\n",

Lack of lumbar support\\n3. Poor entertainment system. Other brands offer a Bose or a bang and olufsen system. This car's audio is WEAK! It is sort of OK at its highest settings.\\n4. Complicated command system. The voice command is OK, but messes up most of the time. Rerouting the GPS is a pain. Not very intuitive at all.\\n5. The car takes a good half-one second to catch up if you suddenly floor the gas pedal - then it is sheer pleasure, with the engine roar and sudden burst of speed!\\n\\nThe Good parts:\\n1. The interiors don't feel cheap, very well done. A true luxury car!\\n2. Low center of gravity, and very good handling. Very smooth start due to the 8 speed gear box.\\n3. The looks ! With the 5 LED headlights, to the complicated body lines! This car is a looker, and people keep staring at it.\\n4. Cost &amp; maintenance. I also own an Audi A4. The windshield wipers on an Audi are $250 Bosch. They are $18 on the Acura!!! You can drive into a honda dealership and get parts, servicing, tune-ups. The german cars will bleed you dry, these won't!\\nThe german cars are quieter inside. But they cost $15,000 more to own, and are horribly expensive to maintain. I've started to spend about a $1000 annually on my Audi - the other germans are very similar.\\n5. The seats are quite alright. I am about 6', I've tested the BMW 3 series and the Merc C-300s. The head room is the same, maybe slightly better on the ILX.\\n\\nThe problems I've faced with mine:\\n1. The cars don't come with a spare tire. BIG PROBLEM. I blew mine in one month, ended up buying a donut. The boot won't fit a full sized spare. Not ideal, but I can live with that.\\n2. The lane correction system on all these cars is a pain in the neck. I now drive with it turned off.\\n3. A problem with the transmission handle shifting to gear mode without the release /safety button being pressed. Has happened once. Will have it checked out at the next servicing. And oh, the servicing, including oil change, carwash &amp; tire rotation was $100 only !!!!!\\nI would love for Honda / Acura to improve the negatives that i've listed, and this will be a really 5 star worth car!\\n</td>\n",

       "0   I love this car.\\nGas mileage, suspension, and stereo are great.\\nBluetooth integration and Pandora integration work perfectly. Suspension and noise cancellation work amazingly well.\\nAlthough it looks small, it has plenty of room and has always been big enough. \\nGas mileage has been from 42 to 45 without really trying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1   I purchased my 2013 ILX from the dealer used with 30k miles in 2016. So far so good. I had a Honda before and loved it so figured my next step would be an Acura. First the positives: Car rides well, love the GPS, blue tooth connectivity, and voice control. For a 4 cylinder vehicle it accelerates quite quickly and is very good on gas. Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "2   I recently purchased a 2013 ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "3   We bought our ILX used and have been incredibly pleased with it thus far.  As a former Prius owner, I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura, although I do miss the 50+ mpg of the Prius.  It's fun to drive, handles well, stops on a dime, and has all of the modern features you'd expect from an Acura.  I primarily drive around town (about 90% of the time) with lots of stopping and am averaging about 37-38 mpg.  I love the simplicity of the interior, which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at.  I hope this awesome car continues to fly under the radar so I'll continue to be one of the only ones on the road driving it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "4   In April of 2015 we were in need of another car. Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "5   Just upgraded from my 5-spd Saab 9-3 sedan to a brand new Acura ilx w/premium package and the 2.4L 6-spd engine.\\nThe premium package comes with nearly everything that you could ask for minus navigation.\\n\\nVery nice engine note that gives the car some personality without sounding like a cheap tuner.\\nThe only knock I could say about the ilx is the interior space which is expected to be small due to the price point and market that Acura intends to target.\\n\\nIf you're in your 20s or early 30s and are looking for something fun to drive without sacrificing the luxury amenities, look no further than the ilx.\\n\\nOh and by the way, I'm getting 35-40 highway mpg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "6   I have had my ILX now for over a month and 1,500 miles. It is an excellent car. The complaints about the 2.0L engine being slow are not accurate. I find it to be very peppy and responsive. Plus I drive 64 miles back and forth from work 5 days a week and I have never gotten less than 30 MPG, with an average of 29 MPG city/hwy driving overall. The interior is of excellent quality and the ride is smooth and quiet. The electronics are excellent and the sound system is very good, I use the XM radio all the time and it never drops out. I'm 6 ft tall, 250 lbs and I fit very comfortably in the car. I've even ridden in the back seat and that was comfortable. It looks great and rides great!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "7   Have not had trouble with maintenance in over 6 years.  I've only had the oil and tires changed. It has never broke down on me. I highly recommend it!. I'm currently at 94,000 miles and get around 32-36mpg total. Full gas tank holds around 11 gallons. I'm still happy with my purchase with no regrets. I got the 2013 model and purchased it pre-owned that same year in May 2013 with 3000 miles on it.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "8   My previous car was a leased 2015 Civic EX-L, but due to a job change I needed to get out of my lease mileage restrictions. I took a look at buying out my Civic, or purchasing another new Honda, but both of those options were thousands of $s more than a pre-owned ILX still under warranty. I am a car nut so I am quite familiar with the ILX and its relation to the Civic platform. The ILX fit my needs perfectly and solved most of the issues I had with my Civic (garbage infotainment system, NVH, pokey acceleration). The ILX is great for my longer highway commute, and the tech package is a must-have for the ELS audio. I don't really use the nav system but it works well the few times I played with it. Would like a bird's eye view option though. The only feature I miss from my Civic is the LaneWatch camera, but turning my head to check my blindspot is very easy and I feel the visibility is slightly better than on my Civic. Car is no rocket, but it is a willing partner when you punch it. No issues passing or getting up to speed at all. MPG is obviously less than my Civic, but I am still getting around 29-30 combined. Worth the MPG trade-off for the comfort level alone. Definitely could use a couple more storage cubbies and maybe another USB outlet, but I'll survive ha. Passengers report he backseat is roomy enough and comfy. I cant imagine why anyone would buy a new Kia Rio or a base Honda Fit when they can get a bulletproof-reliable, well-styled, feature-packed luxury-ish ILX for the same price.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "9   This is the second month I am driving this car to work, everyday for 70 miles. \\n\\nCertainly don't feel like driving a Civic. Indeed, I owned a 2 doors Accord for 9 years and ILX is way more luxury than Accord, hence I don't know why people said it is just an upscale Civic?! Drive before you judge.... \\n\\nCompare to Lexus CT200h and CT200h is not even close to ILX, in luxury and design.

       "12  The Ilx is a great car. I am a Honda/Acura fan which is a big part of why I purchased this car.\\nYou can get more car for the money with Toyota, Honda or Nissan any day, but if you want the Acura badge and build quality you pay the premium. The car handles extremely well, road noise is pretty low and the interior is one of the most comfortable and aesthetically appealing of any car I have owned. The interior isn't large but its done very well. I really enjoy driving this car and it gets its fair share of looks. Don't judge this car by pictures, I went to the dealer to buy a tsx and left with this because when I saw it the body styling really hooked me in.

       "13  I purchased the Acura ILX after owning a Jeep Grand Cherokee for seven years.\\nI really wanted a new JGC Overland, but decided it made more economic sense to look for a comfortable 60 miles/day commuter that would still give the feeling I was driving a solid entry level luxury car with most of todays tech features.\\n\\nThe ILX has a very well engineered interior that seems well above the luxury level of a Civic or other lower end cars and in line with most other cars up to about 40K.\\nIt is a very pleasant place to relax while commuting a couple of hours a day.\\n\\nWith a low 30's budget I compared against the Audi A3, VW GTI, Lexus 250H, and Suburu Outback and decided this was the best choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "15  3 months of ownership and I'm extremely satisfied with my new ILX.\\nVery peppy for a small 4cyl. engine. Ride and handling are very impressive.\\nExcellent use of space on the interior.\\nI'm coming from a mid-size and don't miss the little extra room I previously had.\\nI don't want to see many of them on the road, but everyone should give this car a try.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "17  I helped m Grandma buy a CPO 2013 ILX w/ Tech. package.  She wanted certain thing like a backup camera, leather, and navigation and the only car she could afford, that ticked those boxes was the Acura ILX.  I drive this car a fair amount, so I do have a good sense of the car.  First, this car DOES NOT feel like an Acura.  My dad has a 09 TSX and everything from the materials, comfort, suspension, and performance on the ILX does not feel like it is related to any Acura.  I have read from many forum discussions when the ILX first came out, that it is truly is a civic in disguise, that requires premium fuel and I can attest that it is.  Most built-in navigations are terrible, so I'm not surprised with the ILX's system, but how can a 2013 \"luxury\" sedan have such a cruddy back-up camera?  It does the job, but even the Toyota Corolla comes with a better camera.  The suspension feels like it was made out of very cheap components, as it feels like the right front wheel is already in need of a ball joint.  The exhaust shield fell off and the paint is prone to chipping.  My suggestion to anyone thinking about getting an ILX is to get an older TSX or just get a fully loaded Civic.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "18  My dad and I spent months trying to find the perfect car to me.\\nWhen I finally sat in this one at the dealership, things just clicked and I knew that this was the one. I love the sleek, exterior design, and the interior has really nice, soft leather. Now I'll never get lost thanks to my navigation, and lovely backup camera!!! I just wish this car had blind spot monitors and had memory seating feature, so I wouldn't have to adjust it everytime someone sits in my car! Also, I don't like how the front and wheel interior is black and the rest of my car is beige! But otherwise, amazing performance and a real money saver when it comes\\nto gas. Couldn't be happier with it! Love my birthday present                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "19  If you live in a city where traffic and drivers all appear to have an emergency, be prepared to drive like your part of a funeral procession. This car has one gear that has umph...3rd. Every other gear is designed to keep you from the gas pump and they do. The ILX handles incredible well, takes corners with ease and brakes suddenly when needed. Keep your stereo loud, as you want to drown out the road noise. The interior is sharply designed , but does so with less than stellar Lego material. Looks great, just don't touch anything...kills the illusion. I have never experienced any mechanical failure...not one. I still have great braking left after 67,000 miles. I keep taking my car in, thinking the mechanics who inspect my car, forget to check the brakes. The cars design is fantastic. When another car passes me, as they usually do, they stare at the car or is it me, for moving too slow? Overall, I would buy this again without hesitation. No car has made me laugh so hard with the look of speed and the resiliency to keep me pleased. I do really like this car...just please put the rest of the gears in next time.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "22  This car is comfortable, and feels roomier than its small size would lead you to believe.  The navigation system is easy to use and the screen is clear and large.  The upgraded sound system is better than I would expect in this class of car.  There are a few minor drawbacks to the car, but based on the price point, you have to expect some trade offs.  First, the 150hp engine is sufficient for 80% of situations, but it’s definitely underpowered.  Get the optional 200hp engine if you can (I think in newer models they made it standard).  I have driven a 2018 with the 200hp, and it makes a huge difference.  Second, there are no memory seat buttons.  I didn’t think this would be a big deal when I was car shopping, but I realized quickly that I used memory seats way more often than I thought.  Then again, I’m someone who is overly sensitive to a seat position that’s slightly off from what I’m used to!   It would be nice if they made this model in AWD, but snow traction is about as decent as you can find without all wheel drive.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "23  I love my ILX Hybrid.  Extremely reliable, Great ride and Great gas mileage (more than advertised even when driving in sport mode).  No mechanical failure and I’m up to 97k miles.  Love the Dolby surround sound!

       "24  Hi-I still love my Acura ILX, the highlight of the car is the responsive engine and transmission.  I also think the care is very attractive and I love the way the steering wheel leather feels.  I also think the steering is also very responsive, even thought it is light.  The only downfall to the car is road noise , however I changed the tires and it made a huge difference.  I did research on Tire rack and purchased tires with the highest rating and I am very impressed.  I am not sure why Acura puts the Michelin Pilot mmx4 on the car when they are not rated well for noise.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have to say my new ILX is a great car.\\nThe engine is really responsive and the shifting is really smooth.\\nThe interior is finished very well and the leather wrapped steering wheel feels great on the hands.\\n\\nHandling is excellent, the car goes exactly where you point it.\\nAfter the car is broken in, the car is really sporty to drive.\\nI think the car is underrated.\\nConsumer Reports does a great job recommending the ILX, other reviewers complain that the ILX is underpowered, but I would give it a test drive.\\nI drove the new Accord and the Subaru Legacy and I liked the ILX a lot better.\\nI like how compact and zippy it feels.\\n\\nI am an Acura Fan and in love with the ILX\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "25  I bought the manual 2.4 version about a month ago, and I am completely in love with this car. First, I think I am probably the target consumer (young professional at a corporate job). I wouldn't want a Civic Si, but I definitely wanted a manual transmission (and the MT option is the ONE main reason I chose the ILX over a Lexus IS; I don't care if the IS is faster, I wanted an MT). The sound isolation is good, road comfort is great (I'm not trying to experience all the bumps on the road), and I personally love hearing the tune of engine revving up (it's beautiful, and it's a manual, and that's part of the fun). I am committed to only owning MT cars, and am glad Acura makes a few.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "26  I bought my 2014 ILX 2.4 a little over a month ago, and it's been a great purchase.\\nI did a LOT of research before purchasing this car, and I am very happy that I was not scared off by some of the reviews from the automotive journalism industry.\\n\\n\\nFirst, this car is not a rebadged Civic Si. different dimensions, different suspension setup and hardware. Also no garish wing or ugly red interior inserts like the Si. Yay!\\nGreat manual transmission, too. clutch pickup is spot-on, and shifts are super smooth. nice enough features for the price, but infotainment screen is kinda chintzy, and rear seat passengers really need HVAC vents!

       "27  I was looking for a good commuter with a manual transmission I could hold on to of the next 15 years. I have owned 3 other Hondas so I have seen, first hand, how their powertrains hold up as I maintain them myself. I was interested in either the '16 Civic LX 6MT or the '16 Accord Sport 6MT. I, personally, like the new civic but, at the time, only the LX had the 6MT available. I didn't want to spend ~$19 grand on the base model, base 4 speaker stereo and wheel covers.  I have been spoiled with the features I've come to enjoy in my 2007 Accord EX-L Sdn V6 6MT, I know I was being too harsh on the LX. I began to seriously consider the Accord Sport, it is a gorgeous car on the outside, but I found I would have to give up many features: quality stereo, sunroof and (at the time) leather on the inside. I have always loved the powertrain of the Civic Si, excellent engine and transmission but personally, I didn't want the Si and wasn't too fond of the interior. To every man his taste. I then noticed the ILX. I would never consider buying one brand new for $30k+, but a clean white one at ~$21k @ 10,000 miles and in immaculate shape it became an excellent choice! The new Accord Sport is pushing ~$27k but I got so many more features with the used ILX. I have throughly enjoyed this car and even with the 6MT coming available in the EX-T Civic I find I'm still enjoying my choice without regrets.  (I would really be sad if a Leather/Manual/Turbo civic option had popped up), even with the turbo manual option the Apple Car play is great but it still lacks a bit of a list of features ILX has. Some features I have really enjoyed are the sound system, there is a Sub in the back and the higher wattage is very noticable, much better sound and intensity than my fully loaded 2007 Accord EX-L. The HIDs are excellent, I purchased the car in OR and drove it to CA during a rain storm at night to outrun a snow storm. Those headlights were impressive for that drive, I could see both sides of the road (worried about deer) and much further I have ever been able to see with my other Hondas, the handling is also very light and precise through the mountains. What I wanted in a commuter was good powertrain, this car always puts a smile on my face driving home, this is the best manual transmission I have driven and that engine note never gets old. This thing is quick. Even on starting the engine it reminds you of its capabilities with that aggressive engine note. I've also been pleasantly surprised with the fuel economy. I commonly get ~40 mpg on my 40 mile commute one way, which includes hills and plenty of stop and go, I usually average 31MPG overall with lively city driving. On a longer drive to UT I saw an overall 34.5 MPG on the computer. I've only put premium in it and honestly don't mind the extra dollar or two at each fill up. Even with the newer choices of the Civic Turbo manual and even the excellent Mazda 3 I still went with and couldn't be happier with my choice in the ILX. My only gripe, echoing the many, was no Navigation. Fortunately I have it in my Accord. Honestly, It's a pleasant convenience in it but wasn't a deal breaker in the ILX for me. The screen in the ILX is honestly rather poor, but the sound system quality is what I was looking for. Another gripe is the fact that it revs a little too high for my taste on the freeway, but I like the shorter gear ratio than those longer gears found the Mazda 3 6MT.  The keyless entry and push button start has also an excellent feature I've come to truly enjoy. If you're looking for a good option, the ILX is a solid choice if you can find a good one off lease. This car is a tidy package for the long run. Also the fact that someone designed it so the oil filter is conveniently on the bottom of the engine directly behind the oil drain plug (rather than spilling all over the back of the engine like on the Honda\\n F series engine or spilling all over the subframe on the J series) is brilliant.\\nRead more\\n  \n",
       "28  I own the 2014 ILX base 2.0L 5-sp auto. First off, the 150 hp engine is just fine, thanks. I can cruise at 80 mph on the interstate all day long. I've had no issues running at very high altitude climbing fairly steep grades, and getting up to speed is quick at about 8 sec 0-60 -- once the engine is broken in. It's also economical. I'm averaging 30 mpg with ~8K miles of mixed driving. The differences between the 2014 and 2013 are not minor. The 2014 now comes standard with heated leather seats (driver's is powered), rear-backup camera, 17\" alloys, and additional sound deadening, including active noise reduction. I'm 6'1\" and I fit in the car just fine. Go test drive one yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "29  Disappointing with time.  This vehicle doesn't feel like a comprehensive 'package' - It's an economy car, that's it.  Acura has taken a Civic (which is perfectly good as is) added a great dash, and some engine and suspension tuning and called it a day, and these mechanical touches don't really seem to add anything to the Civic package nor compete with the Civic Si(as if engineers just threw \"good parts\" at the car without testing). In many ways, the result here is an underpowered, loud, econobox with disturbing views from the drivers seat (funhouse drivers mirror, subpar plastic on the lower doors, blindspots for days) with a stereo that doesn't deliver premium sound leave you expecting more                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "30  When I started looking at this car, I found it to be mediocre on paper.    Acceleration, handling, mpg, etc all seemed acceptable, but it didn't stand out.  However, I ended up taking a test drive because manual transmission cars have become hard to find, and they were giving big discounts.  After a test drive though, I realized that this car was something special, and the more I drive it the more I like it.  I'm happy to say that this car has a much higher fun factor than I originally expected.  The clutch and transmission are just a pure joy to use.  It's definitely the nicest manual transmission I've ever had, including multiple VWs, a Saab, and multiple Subarus.  The engine also loves to rev and has a wonderful sound for a 4 cyl.  It's no track monster, but for real road driving, I can't think of a car that was more fun (even more than my WRX) to drive around without doing illegal speeds.  Lastly, I find that the EPA gas mileage is easily exceeded without trying.  If I had to knock it on anything, it's the road noise.  For a 'premium' badge, I would have expected to be more quiet.  However, if you are OK with the normal noise levels found in Hondas/Acuras, this is a great choice for a little sporty car!\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "31  The more I drive this car, the more I love it.  Like many others, I was a little worried I would miss having a turbo but loved the combination of economy, luxury,reliability and good looks that this car offered, at a price I could feel good about. Feels sporty, smooth, and responsive. I can honestly say I haven't missed the horsepower. I can't believe it doesn't get better reviews.  I have the Tech package, and love the bluetooth, the navigation, and the sound.  I rarely get less than 30 mpg and that with considerable city driving.  When you give it gas, it has a healthy rev, and cruises very comfortably at 70-80mph.  Passing is never a problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "32  Was apprehensive at first considering the HP ratings, BUT for the price this car can't be beat! Lots of high-tech and comfort features for <$30K. Heated power comfy seats, rear camera, voice integration, bluetooth, active noise cancellation, NAV, leather, sleek styling. This is NOT just an \"upgraded Civic.\"\\n\\nObviously, engine leaves you wanting, but its buttery smooth and loves to rev, and is plenty for highway passing. Suspension is not too taut like a sports car, but not overly soft. Steering is typical Honda light, but also responsive. Great handling for FWD. Also, super LIGHT car with consistent 30 mpg.\\n\\nOther than power, it has everything I could ask for in an entry luxury sedan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "33  I recently purchased an ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "34  Well, I have the smaller engine in the automatic and it aint a beast..but with the shifter paddles\\nyou can manipulate the gears slightly for a little bit more oooumph. From a quality to price standpoint, this is VERY hard to beat. I looked at Chevy's, Toyota's, even the Mazda 3 and 6, all similar price points. The quality inside and lines out, make this look like and feel like a much more respectable and high quality ride. What car would you rather show up in at a clients house? What car would you rather trust with a child inside? LCD screen is VERY small BUT the trunk holds 2 sets+ of golf clubs.

Great ride, sleek look, great gas, inexpensive to maintain compared to other cars in this class.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "36  Update: My ILX has only continued to perform better with each mile.  The engine and transmission are as smooth as silk and it feels spritley.  It also looks great.  Great car!!!  I really enjoy owning my ILX.  The ILX offers a great value.  For just over $27,000 you get a lot of standard features including leather, 17\" wheels, back-up camera, luxury car dealership service treatment and Acura reliability.  The ILX handles great, for a small engine it is refined and smooth.  Acceleration is decent and the car feels more powerful than 150HP.  On the highway you don't even realize you have hit 80 because it is pretty smooth.  Road noise is the only downfall, but when you are listening to the great stereo you don't hear a thing.   If you read some reviews I think they are unfair, the car is excellent.  I test drove the Audi A3 1.8T and the turbo and love the ILX by far.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "37  Before purchasing this car, I had a Mazda RX-8 which I had owned for 9 years.  I loved the car, I wasn't ready to give it up but the cost of repairs, the difficulty in repairing the car, the nickel and diming from Mazda because of the rotary engine was taking it's toll and it finally came time for me to consider trading the car in for something more reliable.  I had considered Audi and BMW, but the biggest \"want\" on my car wish list was that the vehicle had to be easy to repair and not cost an arm and a leg each time I took it in.  I just wanted something that had the sleekness and handling of my RX-8 but with the engine of a Honda.  So what better than an Acura?  Granted, when I test drove the ILX, I was rather bored, I thought the car was too sedate.  However, I had to remind myself that I was used to the squirreliness of the rear wheel drive on the RX-8 and that the sedateness of the ILX could be good for me.  While the ILX does not handle as well as the RX-8 (I am a rather aggressive driver and enjoyed the manual transmission on the Mazda), the ILX is pretty decent in acceleration, handles corners well (I don't have to worry about fish tailing), and has an overall feeling of \"gliding\" that I really enjoy.  I also love the interior.  Some of the reviews on the ILX will say the interior is not as nice as the Audi A3 or the BMW 3 series, but I beg to differ.  The interior is sleek and comfortable, the user interface on the touchscreen fairly easy to use.  The one complaint I do have is that the navigation app is only compatible with iPhone and as I am a Galaxy user, it is useless to me.  Also one thing to note with this car that salespeople at the dealership may argue with, is that this car performs WAY better on premium gasoline.  When I purchased the car, the sales person said the car takes regular gas.  I put regular in the car and experienced lagging at acceleration, rough idling, and I could feel the car stumbling when I would push down on the gas. When I brought it up to the guy who sold me the car, he said that was impossible, however, when I refueled with premium, the car was back to \"gliding\" and I have no trouble with acceleration.  Use your best judgement but don't always listen to the guy selling the car.  The guy who sold me my car knew nothing about the car and kept saying \"It is a beautiful car, it sells itself\".  Overall, I am very happy I did not go with Audi or BMW and know that when this car will need servicing, I will not walk out missing a huge piece of my paycheck.  It was a great transition from the RX-8.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "38  I just purchased the 2015 ILX 2.4 6 speed manual and must say, this is the most fun car I've ever had. It handles great on curvy roads, the seats feel like they were made for me. The price was even reasonable for the performance and comfort. This is the best manual I have ever driven, it's smooth, it's fast and it's so much fun! I highly recommend this car to anyone who wants a sporty, yet functional car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "39  I was in a 328i BMW which was poor on gas, ripped of on repairs' yet best performance by any of over 25 cars  I have Owned. However this is a great low cost ,strong performance except for poor take off in the rain, yet my wallet  love's it and so do I.

       "42  This car has met all of my expectations and surpassed most of them, it is everything I was looking for at a very reasonable price point. I previously owned a 2014 Civic EX 4dr, which I bought, at least partially, because Civics are traditionally modders, with a lot of potential for customization. Not so much the case (mechanically) anymore, unless you get the SI, but I work in the city and bumper to bumper commuting with a manual, forget it. At any rate, the ILX offered everything I wanted my Civic to become, sporty, both in appearance and performance (big emphasis on performance), as well as more luxury and Honda/Acura's legendary reliability. I did a LOT of research before pulling the trigger on the purchase and I just don't think that anything out there can touch the ILX if price is at all an issue for you. Go to Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Infiniti, Lexus websites and \"Build and Price\" their entry level offerings with same/similar features and you will see what I mean. In NONE of those cases are you getting anywhere near the ILX in features, performance, quality or reliability for under 40K (the model I bought, w/ premium package, stickers at $30,820 with destination charges). If you are looking to buy a status symbol, this isn't the car for you, but if you want luxury quality and performance combined with unmatched reliability, this is definitely worth a look and test drive, I consider it a class leading example of what I call \"practical luxury\". Also worth mention, I had a 2015 ILX base model (with the 2.0) loaner for a day and a half while the dealership installed a remote start and was NOT impressed, the 2015 would not have won me over, I would still be driving the Civic, so if you have an  earlier model and weren't pleased or it didn't meet your expectations, give the 2016 a test drive. \\n\\nThe only Cons I have to offer are getting into and out of the vehicle (at 5'11\" with short legs and a long torso) can be slightly awkward and low speed crawl can be chunky at times (for the first week till you get used to shift points) however from the reviews I have read on its competitors it still excels in this area (I haven't test driven any of them).\\n\\nUPDATE: After 8 months driving it every day, I still love this car. My only takeaway after 8 months is that without Navi the 2 screen layout can feel pretty redundant, but that's such a first world problem I don't even feel good complaining about it. Sport mode is awesome, whether or not you use the paddle shifters, which by the way can be used in normal drive mode as well.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "43  I absolutely adore this car. I have no idea what some people are talking about regarding the seats being uncomfortable. These are the most comfortable seats I've ever driven in. This car is just what I was looking for...a beautiful, reliable and luxurious commuter. The white model really turns heads and by the first week I'd already gotten so many compliments. Interior road noise is perfect, road feel is excellent, steering is excellent, ever little detail in his car screams luxury. Really nothing bad I can say about this car, and no I've not been paid to say these things...this car is just that good.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "44  This is a great combination of luxury and economy.  I paid  $9,000 less than the dealer's best offer on a comparable BMW 320i.  It's pretty quick at 0-60 mph in 6.4 seconds ( .2 seconds faster than the BMW according to zeroto60times.com) but still gets 36 mpg (the same as the BMW epa estimate) on the highway.  After driving the BMW 320i and the X1, the ILX interior materials seemed just slightly inferior.  And the noise and handling were just a little off.  I am very sensitive to squeaks and rattles.  So far, not a single one.  The 8 speed DCT is very smooth and precise.  Driving in sport mode changes everything.  The shift points are at much higher revs and the engine responds much more quickly.  This is my second Acura.  I drove the first one for nearly 200,000 miles and all I did was change the fluids and bulbs...not a single problem. I can't attest to the reliability of the ILX, but I'm betting it will be similarly phenomenal.  The expert reviews are all over the map on this one.  Do you compare it with a Toyota Corolla, or a BMW 2 or 3 series?  Therein lies the problem.  They have to put it in a category to make sense of all the vehicles and this one doesn't fit.  You have to read between the lines.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "45  If you're in the market for an entry level luxury sedan, you're most likely considering the Audi A3, MB CLA or the BMW 320, along with the ILX. Pricing-wise, the base MSRPs are not that far apart; but, once you start adding options, the prices begin to spread apart.  Comparing all the features in an Acura ILX with Technology Plus and A-Spec, the price differences can vary as much as $5k-$10k. Add to that the recent year-end incentives, and the price difference can go as much as $12k.\\n\\nConsidering the reliability of Acura, and its traditionally high resale value, the ILX represents the best value in this category.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "46  I use this car almost exclusively for commuting, about 20 miles each way. It's a good solid car with great value. Acceleration is more than adequate and the extra tech you get with the tech plus package is great. I did have a  problem with my car upon delivery. About a week after I got the car I noticed a vibration, especially in reverse. I brought it in to the dealer and they found that the engine mounts weren't aligned. They fixed it and I was on my way. About a month later the vibrations came back. I brought it back to the dealer and they replaced the engine mounts (covered under warranty). I haven't had a problem since.\\n\\nPros:\\nGreat value for what you spend. Braking is excellent, gives a real secure feeling. I know a lot of pundits complain about the dual screen system but once you get used to it there's no issue.\\n\\nCons:\\nTransmission at highway speed is very smooth. At low speeds, particularly stop and go traffic, the transmission can be very choppy and downright uncomfortable. After about a month of driving I became more attuned to this and am able to avoid a lot of the choppiness. It can still be a minor annoyance. My other complaint would be a lack of lumbar support. Any car that claims to be luxury must have it.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "47  Got a great deal to trade my 2013 ILX for a 2016 ILX Premium pkg Granite Luster/Graystone interior.\\nI never had any problems with my 2013 and really like the updates on the new one. Performance is up due to the new engine but the old one was efficient and peppy. Good ride quality and very good value in the entry level luxury class. Compare to A3, CLA feature for feature and you'll see what I mean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "48  I really love this car.  It has everything I wanted for a great price!\\nPRO:\\n($30,000 out the door)\\nThis is the perfect car for me since I am not searching for people's envy.  This car has everything in my opinion. It has great gas mileage(I am averaging 32/gallon), galore of standard features like my favorites(resetting the gas odometer and mileage whenever I refuel, also 3 different backup camera viewing angle was very helpful when I need to back into my garage).  The leather are very comfortable.  Stereo with 7 speakers and sub-woofer, usb, bluetooth, HDMI, and sat radio keeps me going on my daily grind.  Great value for my hard earned cash.  I would recommend this car to anybody that appreciate great value and reliability.  \\nCON:\\nIf you are looking for true luxury entry-level luxury sedan, this is not it.  As per the review said, the interior are nice but not as luxuries as Mercedes or Audi.  It does not drive with peppiness that you get with Mercedes or Audi.  I find the acceleration weak but the thing is because this car is trying to save gas, so it keep shifting below 2000rpm....(you can do manual shifting if you are into burning up your gas and driving faster).  Your neighbor is not going to b like \"oh my! you got a new Mercedes or Audi!). But you know what? I got good price and great value for my car so F the neighbor...haha!\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "49  Have own the fully loaded Tech plus A-SPEC ILX with the bigger 18\" wheels, GPS and all.\\nFirst what it lacks: 1. A HUD, which I feel is a must for all luxury cars\\n2. Lack of lumbar support\\n3. Poor entertainment system. Other brands offer a Bose or a bang and olufsen system. This car's audio is WEAK! It is sort of OK at its highest settings.\\n4. Complicated command system. The voice command is OK, but messes up most of the time. Rerouting the GPS is a pain. Not very intuitive at all.\\n5. The car takes a good half-one second to catch up if you suddenly floor the gas pedal - then it is sheer pleasure, with the engine roar and sudden burst of speed!\\n\\nThe Good parts:\\n1. The interiors don't feel cheap, very well done. A true luxury car!\\n2. Low center of gravity, and very good handling. Very smooth start due to the 8 speed gear box.\\n3. The looks ! With the 5 LED headlights, to the complicated body lines! This car is a looker, and people keep staring at it.\\n4. Cost & maintenance. I also own an Audi A4. The windshield wipers on an Audi are $250 Bosch. They are $18 on the Acura!!! You can drive into a honda dealership and get parts, servicing, tune-ups. The german cars will bleed you dry, these won't!\\nThe german cars are quieter inside. But they cost $15,000 more to own, and are horribly expensive to maintain. I've started to spend about a $1000 annually on my Audi - the other germans are very similar.\\n5. The seats are quite alright. I am about 6', I've tested the BMW 3 series and the Merc C-300s. The head room is the same, maybe slightly better on the ILX.\\n\\nThe problems I've faced with mine:\\n1. The cars don't come with a spare tire. BIG PROBLEM. I blew mine in one month, ended up buying a donut. The boot won't fit a full sized spare. Not ideal, but I can live with that.\\n2. The lane correction system on all these cars is a pain in the neck. I now drive with it turned off.\\n3. A problem with the transmission handle shifting to gear mode without the release /safety button being pressed. Has happened once. Will have it checked out at the next servicing. And oh, the servicing, including oil change, carwash & tire rotation was $100 only !!!!!\\nI would love for Honda / Acura to improve the negatives that i've listed, and this will be a really 5 star worth car!\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "
