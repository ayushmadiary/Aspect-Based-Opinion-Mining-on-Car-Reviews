Unlike tradi- tional models that analyze attributes separately, our integrated approach provides a comprehen- sive view of brand perception, enhancing the understanding of overall brand sentiment. Rig- orously tested using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, our model accurately cap- tures a wide range of sentiments, from positive to neutral and negative nuances. The findings equip car manufacturers with precise consumer insights, enabling them to refine their market- ing strategies and better align product offerings with consumer expectations.
